## Settings for the experimental parameters pools of a Phantom
# If you are unsure, have a look at the lib/valid_params.yaml file
#  If a default is given, you can omit the declaration to set defaults

# Phantom parameters
# npx: initiates phantom of size (npx, npx) [px], default is 128
# tissues: list of tissues to be simulated from the ones implemented in the tissue_library (./lib), default is
#      gm, wm and csf. Maximum number of tissues is the number of defined compartments.
# base: list of list defining the outer ellipse of the phantom, default is [[0., .6900, .920, 0., 0., 0.]]
# compartments: list of lists, individually defining ellipses to simulate the tissues in, default is
#      [[0, .6624, .874, 0., -.0184, 0.],
#       [0, .16, .41, -.22, -.2, 18],
#       [0, .12, .31, .22, -.12, -12]]
npx: 128
tissues: ["gm", "wm", "csf"]

# Scanner
# b0: field strength [T] (float)
# gamma: gyromagnetic ratio [rad / uT], default is 267.5153 (float)
b0: 3
gamma: 267.5153

# Inhomogeneities are set in the phantom

# Scale
# scale: relative Magnetization after recovery, default is 1 (float)
scale: 1

## Additional simulation settings
# verbose: Verbose output, default is False (bool)
# reset_init_mag: True if magnetization should be reset after each ADC, default is True (bool)
# scale: relative Magnetization after recovery, default is 1 (float)
# max_pulse_samples: sets the number of samples for the shaped pulses, default is 500 (int)
# par_calc: toggles parallel calculations in python simulation, default True (bool)
# verbose: verbose output in C++ simulation, default is False (bool)
reset_init_mag: True
max_pulse_samples: 300
par_calc: True
