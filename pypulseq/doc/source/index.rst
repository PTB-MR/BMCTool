`pypulseq <https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq>`_ enables vendor-neutral pulse sequence design in Python [1]_. The pulse sequences can be
exported as a `.seq` file to be run on  Siemens/`GE <https://toppemri.github.io>`_/
`Bruker <https://github.com/pulseq/bruker_interpreter>`_ hardware by leveraging their respective Pulseq interpreters.
This tool is targeted at MR pulse sequence designers, MRI researchers and other interested users. It is a translation
of the Pulseq framework originally written in Matlab [2]_.

It is strongly recommended to first read the `Pulseq specification <https://pulseq.github.io/specification.pdf>`_
before proceeding. The specification document defines the concepts required for pulse sequence design using `pypulseq`.
